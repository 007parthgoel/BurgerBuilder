This is a web application built on React.js where user can customize a burger with available ingredients and order it. 

We focused on following set of requirements while creating this application.

1.	Creating a responsive layout to support devices with different screen resolution.
2.	In case a user is not authenticated, after building a burger - user will be directed to login/signup page before ordering the burger.
3.	The contact details provided in the checkout page is validated to avoid any invalid data.
4.	List of ingredients is fetched from database to avoid updating list at multiple locations.
5.	The application should display updated image of burger with corresponding ingredients.
6.	The cost of burger will update automatically as ingredients are added/removed.
